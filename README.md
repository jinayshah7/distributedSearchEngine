# Distributed Search Engine (Google Search Clone)

### Feature Wishlist
- Rendering dynamic webpages - Right now this only renders the html that the website returns, it's not running nay javascript.
- URL tracking using URL shortener - All the search results would have a proxy URL which redirects to the actual result. So each time someone clicks something, we know what they searched and what they clicked on.
- Autocomplete - I have no idea how to do this, but I know it's possible.
